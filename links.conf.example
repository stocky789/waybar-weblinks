# Web Links Configuration
# Edit this file to customize your web shortcuts
# Array format: each entry should have a matching label and URL at the same index

# Labels (what appears in the menu with emoji icons)
LINK_LABELS=(
    "🌐 GitHub Repo"
)

# URLs (corresponding links that will open)
LINK_URLS=(
    "https://github.com/stocky789/waybar-weblinks"
)

# Tips:
# - Make sure LINK_LABELS and LINK_URLS have the same number of entries
# - Use any emoji you want in the labels
# - URLs should include https:// or http://
# - To add more links, just add entries to both arrays
